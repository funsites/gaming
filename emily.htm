<h1>Emily Is Away</h1>
<p>Emily Is Away is a game about the old AOL instant messenger where you talk to a girl called, you guessed it, Emily.
Normally, you end up get rejected even though you know there's something blossoming between you two love birds. Did 
you know that there is a chance between you? Yes, you don't get rejected by every girl in the world! :) 
There is a chance that on the last chapter you can say hey to here and she says she can't talk right now. 
Ok so you technically still get rejected but at least you don't go and sit in the corner and cry for the next half hour. 
What just me? Also, you can start off happily by putting your screen name as JohnCena (with the capitals) and first name as John. She will ask for
your name and it will say "My name is JOHN CENAAAAA!" and play John Cena's theme tune.
Also, if put your screen name as FloweyTheFlower and first name as Flowey it also ends up being funny!</p>
