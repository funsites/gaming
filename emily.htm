<h1>Emily Is Away</h1>
<p>Ok so Emily Is Away is a game about the old instant messager were you talk to a girl called, you guest it, Emily and you kinda maybe get rejected even though you know theres somthing blossoming between you two love birds but did you know theres a chance between you ,yes you dont get rejected by every girl in the world :),  there is a chance that on the last chapter you can say hey and she says hi sorry cant talk right now. Ok so you technicly still get rejected but at least you dont go sit in corner and cry for the next half hour. What just me? but you can start off happy by putting you screename as JohnCena (with the capitals) and first name as John yeah its funny oh and put you're screename as FloweyTheFlower and first name as Flowey yep also funny.</p>
